ðŸ“Š Education Dropout Rate Analysis & Forecasting (2019â€“2025)
ðŸ“Œ Overview
This project analyzes Indiaâ€™s school dropout rates using UDISE+ (Unified District Information System for Education Plus) data from 2019 to 2024, builds a Power BI dashboard for insights, and uses Machine Learning (XGBoost) to forecast 2025 dropout rates.

The project helps education policymakers, NGOs, and government planners to:

Track multi-year dropout trends,
Measure gender disparities,
Identify high-risk states,
Forecast dropout rates for proactive interventions

ðŸ“‚ Dataset
Source: UDISE+ â€“ Ministry of Education, Govt. of India
Years Covered: 2019â€“2024
Key Columns:
State,
Level (Primary / Upper Primary / Secondary),
Gender,
Academic Year,
Dropout Rate (%),

ðŸ›  Data Cleaning & Preparation (Power BI Power Query)
Steps Performed:
Loaded Raw Dataset into Power BI Power Query.
Filtered Relevant Years â†’ kept only 2020â€“21 & 2023â€“24 for improvement analysis.
Created Two Copies:

Copy 1 â†’ 2020â€“21 (renamed dropout column â†’ DropoutRate_2020_21)

Copy 2 â†’ 2023â€“24 (renamed dropout column â†’ DropoutRate_2023_24)

Merged Tables on State + Level.

Calculated Improvement:

Improvement = DropoutRate_2020_21 â€“ DropoutRate_2023_24
Positive â†’ improvement

Negative â†’ worsening trend

Removed Unnecessary Columns (academic year, blanks, metadata).

ðŸ“ˆ Dashboard Insights (Power BI)
